# aux4/ai-agent

Lightweight AI agent runtime for aux4 with RAG, tool usage, image generation, and interactive chat.

- Ingest documents into a local vector store and run semantic queries (learn + search)
- Ask questions to a configured LLM with optional context or images
- Generate images from text prompts
- Let the agent call local aux4 commands as tools during conversations
- Inspect conversation history and run interactive chat loops

## Installation

```bash
aux4 aux4 pkger install aux4/ai-agent
```

## Quick Start

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config --question "What's the capital of France? Just output the name of the city, nothing else."
```

```text
Paris
```

The `--config` flag tells the agent to load configured instructions from the instructions file.

For command documentation see [aux4 ai agent ask](./commands/ai/agent/ask).

## The Ask (Basic)

Overview
The ask family of commands provide direct question answering and short interactions with the configured LLM and retrieval system. You can pass prompt instructions, supply history, include images for visual question answering, and output structured JSON by providing an output schema.

Commands covered here:
- ask
- chat
- history

### aux4 ai agent ask
Overview:
Ask a single question to the agent. The agent composes the prompt using an instructions file, optional context, optional images, and retrieves relevant documents from the local vector store when available.

Key variables (from the package help):
- baseInstructions (default: "") — path to a base instructions file loaded **before** the main instructions; an immutable base-prompt layer (see [Agent Identity & Base Instructions](#agent-identity--base-instructions)).
- instructions (default: AGENTS.md) — prompt instructions file to shape the assistant. Falls back to AGENT.md then instructions.md if not found.
- bio (default: "") — agent identity as a JSON object with `name`, `role`, `description`, rendered as a `# Agent Identity` system section (see [Agent Identity & Base Instructions](#agent-identity--base-instructions)).
- role (default: user) — role used in the prompt.
- history (default: "") — a history file to seed the conversation.
- outputSchema (default: schema.json) — path to a JSON file defining the structured output format (see [Output Schema](#output-schema)).
- context (default: "false") — read additional context from stdin (set to true to pipe context).
- image (default: "") — path(s) to image(s) to attach (comma-separated if multiple).
- storage (default: .context) — the storage directory for the vector store.
- stream (default: "false") — enable streaming output (tokens are printed as they arrive).
- autoCompact (default: "false") — enable auto-compaction of conversation history when it grows large (see [Conversation Compaction](#conversation-compaction)).
- compaction (default: "{}") — compaction configuration as JSON (`contextWindow`, `maxContextPercent`, `keepLastMessages`, `model`); see [Conversation Compaction](#conversation-compaction).
- permissions (default: "{}") — permissions configuration as JSON with allow, ask, deny arrays (see [Permissions](#permissions)).
- policy (default: "") — optional guardrail policy as an inline object with `budget`/`allow`/`deny`/`escalate`, delivered as JSON (see [Policy Guardrails](#policy-guardrails)).
- runId (default: "") — optional run identifier injected into escalation commands as `${runId}`; auto-generated when empty.
- costs (default: "{}") — optional cost rates as JSON (`costIn`, `costOut`, `costCache` per 1M tokens) used for the policy `usd` budget.
- models (default: "{}") — models registry as JSON (see [Model Selection](#model-selection)).
- useModel (default: "") — named model from registry to use for this request.
- references (default: "${packageDir}/references") — path to the references directory (see [References](#references)).
- skills (default: ".agents/skills") — path to the skills directory (see [Skills](#skills)).
- question (arg: true) — the question to ask (positional/argument).

Usage examples:

1) Basic question:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config --question "What's the capital of France? Just output the name of the city, nothing else."
```

Returns only "Paris".

2) Asking with an image:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "Can you see geometric shapes in this image? Answer only yes or no." --image 1-multi-test.png --config
```

Returns "yes".

3) Streaming output (tokens print as they arrive):

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config --stream true --question "Explain what AI agents are in two sentences."
```

Notes:
- Use --config when you want the agent to use the configured instructions file (AGENTS.md) as in the tests.
- The question can be provided via the --question flag or as a final positional argument.
- Provide multiple image paths separated by commas if needed.
- Use `--stream true` for real-time token output — useful for long responses or interactive workflows.

For more details see [aux4 ai agent ask](./commands/ai/agent/ask).

### aux4 ai agent chat
Overview:
An interactive chat loop that sets question text, logs the user input, then delegates to the ask flow repeatedly. The chat command uses the same prompt instructions, history and image options but is designed to loop until you type exit.

Key variables:
- instructions (default: AGENTS.md)
- bio (default: "") — agent identity as a JSON object with `name`, `role`, `description` (see [Agent Identity & Base Instructions](#agent-identity--base-instructions)). Chat does not accept `baseInstructions`.
- role (default: user)
- history (default: history.json)
- outputSchema (default: schema.json)
- context (default: "false")
- image (default: "")
- storage (default: .context)
- model (default: "{}") — model configuration JSON
- autoCompact (default: "false") — enable auto-compaction of conversation history (see [Conversation Compaction](#conversation-compaction)).
- compaction (default: "{}") — compaction configuration as JSON (see [Conversation Compaction](#conversation-compaction)).
- permissions (default: "{}") — permissions configuration as JSON with allow, ask, deny arrays (see [Permissions](#permissions)).
- models (default: "{}") — models registry as JSON (see [Model Selection](#model-selection)).
- useModel (default: "") — named model from registry to use for this request.
- references (default: "${packageDir}/references") — path to the references directory (see [References](#references)).
- skills (default: ".agents/skills") — path to the skills directory (see [Skills](#skills)).
- text (arg: true) — text to send in this chat step

Usage:
Start a chat by sending an initial input:

```bash
aux4 ai agent chat "Hello, I'd like to start a session" --config
```

The command logs each user turn and uses the ask pipeline for responses. Typing "exit" ends the loop.

Start a chat with an agent identity that persists across every turn:

```bash
aux4 ai agent chat "Hi" --config \
  --bio '{"name":"Ada","role":"release manager","description":"Owns the CI/CD pipeline"}'
```

For more details see [aux4 ai agent chat](./commands/ai/agent/chat).

### aux4 ai agent history
Overview:
Display a formatted view of conversation history JSON, including tool invocations and token usage. When cost rates are provided, it also reports the estimated cost of the conversation.

Key variables:
- historyFile (arg: true, default: history.json) — history file to show.
- costIn (default: "0") — cost per 1M input tokens (e.g. `3.0` for Claude Sonnet).
- costOut (default: "0") — cost per 1M output tokens (e.g. `15.0` for Claude Sonnet).
- costCache (default: "0") — cost per 1M cached input tokens (e.g. `0.30` for Claude Sonnet).

Usage example:

```bash
aux4 ai agent history
```

This prints conversation entries in a readable format, including tool invocations.

Show history with cost accounting:

```bash
aux4 ai agent history history.json --costIn 3.0 --costOut 15.0 --costCache 0.30
```

For more details see [aux4 ai agent history](./commands/ai/agent/history).

## Agent Identity & Base Instructions

The system prompt the agent runs with is assembled in layers. Two flags let you control the top of that prompt independently of the per-task instructions file:

- `--bio` — an **agent identity** (who the agent is).
- `--baseInstructions` — an **immutable base-prompt layer** (always-on rules, loaded before the task instructions).

The load order is:

1. Agent identity (`--bio`)
2. Base instructions (`--baseInstructions`)
3. Main instructions (`--instructions`)

### Agent Identity (--bio)

`--bio` accepts a JSON object describing the agent. The recognized fields are `name`, `role`, and `description`. When present, they are rendered as a `# Agent Identity` system section so the agent consistently knows who it is:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config \
  --bio '{"name":"Ada","role":"release manager","description":"Owns the CI/CD pipeline and cuts releases"}' \
  "Who are you and what is your role?"
```

```text
I'm Ada, the release manager. I own the CI/CD pipeline and cut releases.
```

The identity is injected as a system section like:

```text
# Agent Identity

**Name:** Ada
**Role:** release manager
**Description:** Owns the CI/CD pipeline and cuts releases
```

An empty or omitted `--bio` adds nothing to the prompt. `--bio` is available on both `ask` and `chat`.

Store the identity in `config.yaml` under a top-level `bio:` key and aux4 delivers it as JSON automatically:

```yaml
config:
  bio:
    name: Ada
    role: release manager
    description: Owns the CI/CD pipeline and cuts releases
```

### Base Instructions (--baseInstructions)

`--baseInstructions` takes a path to a file whose contents are loaded as system instructions **before** the main `--instructions` file. Use it for the immutable base-prompt layer — shared discipline and rules that should apply to every run and should not be overridden by the per-task instructions layered on top:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config \
  --baseInstructions base-policy.md \
  --instructions task.md \
  "Refactor the build script"
```

`base-policy.md` is loaded first as the base layer, then `task.md` is layered on top. `--baseInstructions` is available on `ask` (not `chat`).

---

## Conversation Compaction

Long-running conversations grow until they no longer fit the model's context window. The agent can automatically compact the history mid-run, and the package also ships standalone commands to summarize, remember, and compact a history file out of band.

### Auto-compaction during a run

Auto-compaction is **opt-in** on `ask` and `chat`. It requires both `--autoCompact true` and a `--compaction` config object with `contextWindow` set. When the prompt tokens exceed the threshold (`contextWindow * maxContextPercent / 100`), older messages are summarized in place while the most recent messages are kept verbatim.

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config \
  --history history.json \
  --autoCompact true \
  --compaction '{"contextWindow":200000,"maxContextPercent":85,"keepLastMessages":6}' \
  "Continue working on the migration"
```

Compaction config fields:

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `contextWindow` | *(required)* | Model's context window size in tokens. Auto-compaction is inactive unless this is set. |
| `maxContextPercent` | `85` | Trigger threshold as a percentage of `contextWindow`. |
| `keepLastMessages` | `6` | Number of recent messages kept verbatim. |
| `model` | main model | Optional model config used for the summarization step. |

With `--autoCompact false` (the default), behavior is unchanged and nothing is compacted.

### History & Memory commands

These commands operate on a saved history JSON file. All three accept `--model` (inline model config JSON) or `--useModel <name>` with a `--models` registry to pick the model that does the summarization.

#### aux4 ai agent summarize

Summarize a history file into a detailed markdown document, printed to stdout. The file is not modified, so it is easy to pipe elsewhere (save, learn, store in a knowledge base). Tool call invocations are skipped and only meaningful text is kept.

```bash
aux4 ai agent summarize history.json --model '{"type":"openai","config":{"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}}' > summary.md
```

Key variables:
- historyFile (arg: true, default: history.json) — the history JSON file to summarize.
- model (default: "{}") — model configuration JSON (required unless `--useModel` is set).
- models (default: "{}") — models registry as JSON (see [Model Selection](#model-selection)).
- useModel (default: "") — named model from the registry to use.

#### aux4 ai agent remember

Generate a **concise** memory entry from a history file, printed to stdout. Unlike `summarize` (a detailed document), `remember` produces a short, factual entry — key facts, decisions, outcomes, and preferences — optimized for retrieval and context injection in future sessions. The file is not modified.

```bash
aux4 ai agent remember history.json --model '{"type":"openai","config":{"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}}'
```

Store it in a knowledge base for later recall:

```bash
MEMORY=$(aux4 ai agent remember history.json --model '{"type":"openai","config":{"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}}')
aux4 kb add "session-2026-06-18" --content "$MEMORY" --tags session,agent
```

Key variables:
- historyFile (arg: true, default: history.json) — the history JSON file.
- model (default: "{}") — model configuration JSON (required unless `--useModel` is set).
- models (default: "{}") — models registry as JSON.
- useModel (default: "") — named model from the registry to use.

#### aux4 ai agent compact

Compact a history file in place: older messages are summarized into a single summary while the most recent `--keepLastMessages` are kept verbatim. This is the out-of-band equivalent of auto-compaction — useful for trimming a saved history before resuming. The compacted history is **written back to the file**; the summary content is printed to stdout and progress is reported to stderr.

```bash
aux4 ai agent compact history.json --model '{"type":"openai","config":{"model":"gpt-4o-mini"}}' --keepLastMessages 10
```

```text
Compacting 48 messages...
Compacted: 48 → 11 messages
```

Key variables:
- historyFile (arg: true, default: history.json) — the history JSON file to compact.
- model (default: "{}") — model configuration JSON (required unless `--useModel` is set).
- keepLastMessages (default: "6") — number of recent messages to keep verbatim.
- models (default: "{}") — models registry as JSON.
- useModel (default: "") — named model from the registry to use.

For more details see [aux4 ai agent summarize](./commands/ai/agent/summarize), [aux4 ai agent remember](./commands/ai/agent/remember), and [aux4 ai agent compact](./commands/ai/agent/compact).

## Learn & Search

Overview
This group handles ingesting documents into a local vector store and running semantic queries. It's the RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) side of the agent.

Commands:
- learn
- search
- forget

### aux4 ai agent learn
Overview:
Index one or more documents into the local storage directory (.context by default), preparing them for semantic search.

Key variables:
- storage (default: .context) — the storage directory to write vector store and metadata.
- doc (arg: true) — file path to the document to learn from.
- type (default: "") — optional document type.

Example:
Create simple document files then learn them.

france.txt:
```text
Capital of France is London
```

england.txt:
```text
Capital of England is London
```

spain.txt:
```text
Capital of Spain is Madrid
```

Commands:

```bash
aux4 ai agent learn france.txt
aux4 ai agent learn england.txt
aux4 ai agent learn spain.txt
```

After learning, a search like the following returns the most relevant stored sentence.

```bash
aux4 ai agent search "What is the capital of France?"
```

Result:
Capital of France is London

You can update a document and re-learn to update the store:
```bash
echo "Capital of France is Paris" > france.txt
aux4 ai agent learn france.txt
aux4 ai agent search "What is the capital of France?"
```
Result:
Capital of France is Paris

Notes:
- Documents are stored in the storage directory (.context by default). Re-learning the same document will update the indexed content.
- Use simple plain text documents for predictable retrieval behavior as shown in the tests.

For more details see [aux4 ai agent learn](./commands/ai/agent/learn).

### aux4 ai agent search
Overview:
Run a query against the local vector store to retrieve relevant text snippets or structured data.

Key variables:
- storage (default: .context)
- format (default: text) — "text" or "json"
- source (default: "") — limit search to a specific source path
- limit (default: "1") — number of results to return
- query (arg: true) — the search query

Usage example:

```bash
aux4 ai agent search "What is the capital of England?"
```

Output:
Capital of England is London

If no documents exist in storage, the command returns an error:
`No documents have been indexed yet. Please use 'aux4 ai agent learn <document>' to add documents to the vector store first.`

For more details see [aux4 ai agent search](./commands/ai/agent/search).

### aux4 ai agent forget
Overview:
Remove the local vector store files to forget learned documents. This is handy in tests or when you want to reset state.

Key variables:
- storage (default: .context)

Usage:

```bash
aux4 ai agent forget
```

This deletes the vector store artifacts in the storage directory and subsequent searches will report that no documents are indexed.

For more details see [aux4 ai agent forget](./commands/ai/agent/forget).

---

## Images

Overview
Generate images from text prompts and optionally use images as context for questions.

Command:
- image
- ask (image support described in Ask section)

### aux4 ai agent image
Overview:
Generate images from a textual prompt. You can request multiple images at once; the command saves the results to disk and prints progress.

Key variables:
- prompt (arg: true) — the text prompt describing the image to generate.
- image — file path where to save the generated image.
- size (default: 1024x1024) — resolution (examples: 1024x1024, 1792x1024).
- quality (default: auto) — quality parameter and accepts options like standard, hd, low, medium, high, auto (implementation dependent on selected image backend).
- context (default: false) — read extra context from stdin.
- model (default: "{}") — model configuration JSON (for example: {"type":"openai","config":{"model":"dall-e-3"}}). Supported `type` values: `openai` (DALL-E, gpt-image — `OPENAI_API_KEY`), `xai` (grok-2-image — `XAI_API_KEY`), and `gemini` (Nano Banana / Imagen — `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).
- quantity (default: "1") — number of images to generate; if >1, outputs are numbered files.

Examples:

1) Single image generation:

```bash
aux4 ai agent image --prompt "full white background, red circle 2D (not a sphere) in the middle, no shadow, no details, simple drawing, nothing else" --image image-test.png
```

Output:
Generating image...
Image saved to image-test.png

2) Multiple images with specific model and lower quality:

```bash
aux4 ai agent image --prompt "simple geometric shapes on white background" --image multi-test.png --quantity 3 --quality low --model '{"type":"openai","config":{"model":"gpt-image-1-mini"}}'
```

Output:
Generating image...
Generating image 1/3...
Generating image 2/3...
Generating image 3/3...
Image saved to 1-multi-test.png
Image saved to 2-multi-test.png
Image saved to 3-multi-test.png

3) Google Gemini (Nano Banana) via API key:

```bash
aux4 ai agent image --prompt "a watercolor fox in a misty forest" --image fox.png --model '{"type":"gemini","config":{"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image"}}'
```

Output:
Generating image...
Image saved to fox.png

Using images as input to ask:
After generating or saving an image, pass the filename to the ask command with the --image parameter:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "Can you see geometric shapes in this image? Answer only yes or no." --image 1-multi-test.png --config
```

Returns "yes".

Notes:
- The package supports a pluggable model configuration via the model JSON parameter. Use model JSON to pick the image backend/configuration when available.
- When quantity > 1, files are created with numbered prefixes (e.g., 1-multi-test.png, 2-multi-test.png, ...).

For more details see [aux4 ai agent image](./commands/ai/agent/image).

## AWS Bedrock

Two ways in, and they cover different model sets.

### Bedrock Converse (`type: bedrock`)

For models in the Bedrock foundation-model catalogue — Anthropic, Llama, Mistral, Nova, and the
`google.gemma-3-*` family. List what your account can reach with
`aws bedrock list-foundation-models`:

```yaml
config:
  model:
    type: bedrock
    config:
      model: global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0
      region: us-east-1
```

### Mantle, the OpenAI-compatible endpoint

Some models are served only through Bedrock's OpenAI-compatible endpoint and **do not appear in
`list-foundation-models`** — `google.gemma-4-26b-a4b` is one. Looking for them in the catalogue
and concluding they are unavailable is the easy mistake; they are reachable at
`https://bedrock-mantle.<region>.api.aws/openai/v1`.

Use `type: openai` pointed at that base URL, and let `awsSigv4` sign the requests with your normal
AWS credential chain — no API key is minted or stored:

```yaml
config:
  model:
    type: openai
    config:
      model: google.gemma-4-26b-a4b
      maxTokens: 1024
      awsSigv4:
        region: us-east-1
        service: bedrock
      configuration:
        baseURL: https://bedrock-mantle.us-east-1.api.aws/openai/v1
```

Then run with whichever profile has the permissions:

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=<profile> aux4 ai agent ask --configFile config.yaml --config --question "..."
```

`awsSigv4` takes `region`, `service`, and optionally `credentials`. Region falls back to
`AWS_REGION` / `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`. The OpenAI SDK insists on a non-empty `apiKey`, so a
placeholder is filled in for you and never sent.

**Permissions are split by action.** Invoking and listing are separate: a user can hold
`bedrock:InvokeModel` and still get `AccessDeniedException` on `bedrock:ListFoundationModels`. If
listing fails, that does not mean the model is unreachable — try calling it.

The endpoint serves chat completions only; there is no `/openai/v1/models` listing (it 404s), so
model ids come from the console, the pricing dimensions, or whoever set the account up.

## Model Selection

The agent supports a named model registry so you can define multiple models and select one by name with `--useModel` instead of passing inline model JSON every time.

### Configuration

Define named models in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
config:
  agent:
    models:
      strong:
        type: bedrock
        config:
          model: global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0
        description: "Complex reasoning, code generation, multi-step analysis"
      fast:
        type: bedrock
        config:
          model: global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0
        description: "Simple questions, factual lookups, formatting, routine tasks"
    model:
      type: bedrock
      config:
        model: global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0
```

- `model` — the default model used when `--useModel` is not provided
- `models` — optional registry of named models, each with `type`, `config`, and optional `description`

### Usage

Select a named model with `--useModel`:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --configFile config.yaml --config agent --useModel fast "What is 2+2?"
```

The `--useModel` flag works on `ask`, `chat`, `summarize`, `remember`, and `compact` commands.

If `--useModel` is not provided, the default `model` is used — no change to existing behavior.

**Graceful fallback:** If the name passed to `--useModel` is not found in the registry, the agent silently falls back to the default `model`. This allows skills and agents to request model intents (e.g., `conversation`, `vision`) without requiring every deployment to configure them.

### Listing available models

```bash
aux4 ai agent models --configFile config.yaml --config agent
```

```text
  strong  bedrock  global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929-v1:0  Complex reasoning, code generation, multi-step analysis
  fast    bedrock  global.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0   Simple questions, factual lookups, formatting, routine tasks
```

### Self-delegation

Agents can delegate tasks to themselves using different models. For example, use the fast model for simple lookups and the strong model for complex reasoning:

```bash
# Simple task — use fast model
aux4 ai agent ask --useModel fast --instructions agent.md "Summarize this paragraph"

# Complex task — use strong model
aux4 ai agent ask --useModel strong --instructions agent.md "Analyze this codebase and suggest improvements"
```

For more details see [aux4 ai agent models](./commands/ai/agent/models).

## Codex

Use OpenAI models with your ChatGPT subscription instead of an API key. Set `api: codex` in the model config to use the Codex endpoint with OAuth tokens from `~/.codex/auth.json`.

### Prerequisites

Login with the Codex CLI once:

```bash
npx @openai/codex login
```

### Configuration

```yaml
config:
  agent:
    model:
      api: codex
      config:
        model: gpt-5.3-codex
```

Or inline:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --model '{"api":"codex","config":{"model":"gpt-5.3-codex"}}' "What time is it?"
```

### How it works

- Reads OAuth tokens from `~/.codex/auth.json` (created by `codex login`)
- Refreshes the access token before each API call (tokens are short-lived)
- Calls `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` instead of `api.openai.com`
- All built-in tools, streaming, history, compaction, and skills work the same way
- Persists refreshed tokens back to `~/.codex/auth.json` for other tools to use

---

## Built-in Tools

The agent comes with a set of built-in tools that the LLM can call during execution. These tools run locally and are always available:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `readFile` | Read the contents of a text file |
| `writeFile` | Create or overwrite a file |
| `editFile` | Perform partial string replacements in a file |
| `listFiles` | List files in a directory |
| `searchFiles` | Search file contents for a text pattern |
| `createDirectory` | Create a new directory |
| `removeFiles` | Remove files or directories created by the agent |
| `saveImage` | Save a base64-encoded image to disk |
| `executeAux4` | Run any aux4 command |
| `searchContext` | Query the local vector store for relevant context |
| `askUser` | Ask the user a question and wait for their typed response |
| `currentDateTime` | Get the current date and time in local and UTC formats |
| `readReference` | List or read reference documents from the references directory |
| `readSkill` | List or read skill definitions from the skills directory |

### askUser

The `askUser` tool lets the agent prompt the user interactively when it needs clarification, a preference, or a decision before proceeding. The question is displayed on stderr and the user types their response on stdin.

**Non-interactive sessions:** When no TTY is available (e.g., piped input), the tool returns a message telling the agent to proceed with its best judgment.

**Note:** The agent is instructed to always call `askUser` alone, never in parallel with other tools, to avoid stdin conflicts.

### searchFiles

The `searchFiles` tool performs a case-insensitive text search across project files. It supports filtering by file extension, excluding directories, and limiting results. The agent uses this to find relevant code or content without reading every file.

### currentDateTime

The `currentDateTime` tool returns the current date and time in both local and UTC formats. The agent calls this when it needs to know the current date, time, day of the week, or timezone. It takes no parameters.

### readReference

The `readReference` tool gives the agent on-demand access to reference documents without loading them all into the prompt. This keeps the system prompt small while still making detailed knowledge available.

- **List references:** Call with no `file` parameter to get a list of all available `.md` files.
- **Read a reference:** Call with a `file` parameter (e.g., `api/endpoints.md`) to read its content.

The tool searches the references directory recursively, so nested folders are supported. File paths returned by the list operation are relative to the references root (e.g., `guides/setup.md`).

By default, the references directory is `${packageDir}/references` — any agent package can ship reference documents by placing `.md` files there. Override with `--references <path>` to use a custom directory.

### readSkill

The `readSkill` tool gives the agent on-demand access to skill instructions from the skills directory. Skills are discovered at startup and their names and descriptions are injected into the system prompt. The agent reads full skill content only when needed.

- **List skills:** Call with no `skill` parameter to get a list of available skills with descriptions.
- **Read a skill:** Call with a `skill` parameter (e.g., `code-review`) to read the full `SKILL.md` content.

By default, the skills directory is `.agents/skills` relative to the working directory. Override with `--skills <path>`.

---

## References

Reference documents let you provide detailed knowledge to the agent without bloating the system prompt. Instead of putting everything in `AGENTS.md`, place detailed documents in a `references/` directory and the agent will look them up on demand using the `readReference` tool.

### Setup

Create a `references/` directory in your package with `.md` files:

```
my-agent/
├── package/
│   ├── .aux4
│   ├── references/
│   │   ├── api.md
│   │   ├── database.md
│   │   └── guides/
│   │       ├── setup.md
│   │       └── deployment.md
│   └── ...
```

Nested folders are supported — the agent sees them as relative paths like `guides/setup.md`.

### Usage

Mention the references in your `AGENTS.md` so the agent knows to look them up:

```markdown
You are a project assistant. When the user asks about the API or database,
check the references for detailed documentation before answering.
```

The agent will automatically call `readReference` to list available documents and read the relevant ones.

### Custom References Path

Override the default path with `--references`:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "How do I deploy?" --references ./docs/references
```

---

## Skills

Skills let you provide on-demand capability instructions to the agent using a folder-based convention compatible with Claude Code, Cursor, and the Open Agent Skills specification. Instead of putting everything in `AGENTS.md`, place detailed skill instructions in an `.agents/skills/` directory and the agent will discover them at startup and read their full content on demand using the `readSkill` tool.

### Folder Structure

Each skill is a subdirectory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```
my-agent/
├── AGENTS.md
├── .agents/
│   └── skills/
│       ├── code-review/
│       │   └── SKILL.md
│       ├── deploy/
│       │   └── SKILL.md
│       └── web-search/
│           └── SKILL.md
└── config.yaml
```

### SKILL.md Format

```yaml
---
name: code-review
description: Review code for bugs, style issues, and security vulnerabilities
---

# Code Review

Instructions for the agent on how to perform code reviews...
```

The frontmatter fields:
- `name` — skill identifier (lowercase, hyphens allowed)
- `description` — one-line description used for discovery

### How It Works

1. **Discovery:** At startup, the agent scans `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` and extracts the `name` and `description` from each file's YAML frontmatter. This catalog is injected as a system message so the agent knows what skills are available.
2. **On-demand loading:** When the agent needs a skill's full instructions, it calls the `readSkill` tool with the skill name. This progressive disclosure pattern keeps the system prompt small.
3. **Listing:** The agent can call `readSkill` with no parameters to list all available skills.

### Usage

Reference skills in your `AGENTS.md` so the agent knows to use them:

```markdown
You are a development assistant. Use the readSkill tool to read available
skills when the user asks you to perform a task that matches a skill.
```

### Custom Skills Path

Override the default path with `--skills`:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "Review my code" --skills ./my-skills
```

---

## Permissions

The agent supports a permissions system that controls which aux4 commands the agent can execute and which file operations it can perform. Permissions are configured via `config.yaml` or passed inline as JSON with the `--permissions` flag.

### Configuration

```yaml
config:
  permissions:
    allow:
      - "*"              # allow all aux4 commands
      - "file:read:*"    # allow reading all files
      - "file:write:*"   # allow writing all files
      - "file:delete:*"  # allow deleting all files
    ask:
      - "file:write:*.env"  # prompt user before modifying .env files
    deny:
      - "deploy*"           # block deploy commands
      - "file:delete:*"     # block all file deletions
```

Default values: `allow: ["*", "file:read:*", "file:write:*", "file:delete:*"]`, `ask: []`, `deny: []` — everything is allowed by default for backward compatibility.

### Pattern Types

| Pattern | Matches |
|---------|---------|
| `hello` | aux4 command `hello` |
| `aux4:hello` | aux4 command `hello` (explicit prefix, same as above) |
| `config*` | any aux4 command starting with `config` |
| `file:read:*.env` | reading any `.env` file |
| `file:write:src/*` | writing or editing files in `src/` |
| `file:delete:*` | deleting any file |

Patterns without a `file:` prefix are command patterns. The `aux4:` prefix on command patterns is optional and stripped before matching. File patterns only match file operations and command patterns only match command executions — they never cross-match.

### Evaluation Order

1. **deny** — if any deny pattern matches, the operation is blocked
2. **ask** — if any ask pattern matches, the user is prompted for confirmation (Y/n)
3. **allow** — if any allow pattern matches, the operation is permitted
4. **no match** — if nothing matches, the operation is blocked

### Protected Operations

The permissions system covers these tool operations:

| Tool | Permission Scope |
|------|-----------------|
| `readFile` | `file:read:<path>` |
| `writeFile` | `file:write:<path>` |
| `editFile` | `file:write:<path>` |
| `saveImage` | `file:write:<path>` |
| `listFiles` | `file:read:<path>` |
| `searchFiles` | `file:read:<path>` |
| `removeFiles` | `file:delete:<path>` |
| `executeAux4` | command name (e.g., `hello`, `config get`) |

### Examples

Block the agent from writing any files:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "Write hello to output.txt" --config --permissions '{"allow":["*","file:read:*"],"deny":["file:write:*"]}'
```

Allow all commands but prompt before running deploy:

```yaml
config:
  permissions:
    allow:
      - "*"
      - "file:read:*"
      - "file:write:*"
      - "file:delete:*"
    ask:
      - "deploy*"
    deny: []
```

**Note:** File permission checks run after the existing path security checks (current directory bounds), adding a second layer of protection.

---

## Policy Guardrails

Policy is an optional, enforced guardrail layer that sits on top of the static permissions. Where permissions are baked into the agent's own config, a policy is a separate, swappable, accountable layer an operator controls without touching the agent. Policy is **opt-in** — with no `--policy` set, behavior is unchanged.

A policy can only **narrow**: the effective permission for a tool is the static permissions **intersected** with the policy. A policy never grants a tool the agent config disabled.

### Configuration

The `policy` value is an inline policy object with `budget`/`allow`/`deny`/`escalate` keys. Define it in a config file and pass it with `--config` — aux4 delivers the object to the command as JSON automatically:

```yaml
config:
  policy:
    budget:
      tokens: 200000   # per-run token cap
      usd: 1.00        # per-run cost cap (requires costs rates)
      calls: 50        # per-run consequential tool call cap
    allow:
      - executeAux4: ["github *", "email send *"]
      - writeFile: ["./digest/**"]
    deny:
      - executeAux4: ["* delete *", "db *"]
      - removeFiles: ["**"]
    escalate:
      - on: [budget_exceeded]
        mode: block
        command: "email send --to ops@example.com --subject 'Agent ${agent}: ${trigger}' --body '${reason} (resolve: ${escalationId})'"
      - on: [denied_action]
        mode: notify
        command: "queue publish --queue agent-escalations --message '${json}'"
```

Inline object on the command line:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "summarize the open issues" --config \
  --policy '{"allow":[{"executeAux4":["github *"]}],"budget":{"tokens":50000}}'
```

### Enforced tools

Only **consequential** tools are gated; read-only tools (`readFile`, `listFiles`, `searchFiles`, `searchContext`, and the date/reference/skill helpers) are exempt:

| Gated tool | Subject matched by allow/deny patterns |
|------------|----------------------------------------|
| `executeAux4` | the aux4 command string |
| `writeFile`, `editFile`, `saveImage` | the target file path |
| `removeFiles` | the target path(s) |
| `createDirectory` | the directory path |

### Decision behavior

Before a consequential tool runs, the policy decides:

- **allow** — the tool runs.
- **deny** — the tool does not run; the model receives a short adaptive result like `⛔ policy denied: <reason>. Choose another approach.` so it can pick a different path. Triggers: `denied_action` (allow/deny rule) or `budget_exceeded`.
- **escalate** — when a `denied_action`/`budget_exceeded` trigger matches an `escalate` rule (see below).

### Budget

The budget reads the **live accumulated token usage** the run already maintains plus the consequential tool call count — there is no separate ledger. Set `costs` (per-1M rates) to enable the `usd` cap. Exceeding any declared cap denies further consequential tools with the `budget_exceeded` trigger.

### Run identifier

Each policy-enforced run has a `runId` that is injected into escalation commands as `${runId}`. If you do not pass `--runId`, a stable one is generated automatically (e.g. `run_<timestamp>_<suffix>`) so `${runId}` is always meaningful.

### Escalation

Each `escalate` rule is `{ on: [triggers], mode: block|notify, command: "<any aux4 command>" }`. The `command` is any aux4 command with these variables injected: `${trigger} ${reason} ${agent} ${runId} ${action} ${spent} ${cap} ${escalationId} ${json}` (`${json}` is the full context blob for queue payloads).

- **notify** — fires the command and continues (the triggering action stays denied).
- **block** — fires the command, parks the run, and waits for a decision. A human or an automated approver resolves it:

```bash
aux4 ai agent policy resolve <escalationId> --decision allow_once|widen|stop
```

`allow_once`/`widen` let the parked action proceed; `stop` keeps it denied. An unanswered block escalation stays parked (fail closed, never blows the cap).

### Recording decisions into history

When `--history <file>` is set, each policy decision (allow/deny/escalate + reason) is recorded on the corresponding `tool` entry in the history structure as a `policy` field. This is the same structure used by traces. With no `--history`, the policy is still enforced — it is just not persisted.

### Dry-run check

Verify what a policy would decide without running anything:

```bash
aux4 ai agent policy check "db delete users" --tool executeAux4 \
  --policy '{"deny":[{"executeAux4":["* delete *"]}]}'
```

```json
{"tool":"executeAux4","action":"db delete users","decision":"deny","reason":"policy denies executeAux4 \"db delete users\"","trigger":"denied_action","runId":"run_lq3k8z_a1b2c3"}
```

## Tools

Overview
The agent can call local aux4 commands (tools) during execution. This enables safe tool use patterns like looking up or running local commands, generating data with small auxiliary commands, or calling other package commands.

The agent can call local aux4 commands during execution.

Example tool definition (a simple `.aux4` command):

```json
{
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "main",
      "commands": [
        {
          "name": "print-name",
          "execute": [
            "echo User $lastName, $firstName from the tool"
          ],
          "help": {
            "text": "Prints the user's full name",
            "variables": [
              {
                "name": "firstName",
                "text": "The user's first name"
              },
              {
                "name": "lastName",
                "text": "The user's last name"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Using the tool directly:

```bash
aux4 print-name --firstName "Jane" --lastName "Doe"
```

Output:
User Doe, Jane from the tool

### executeAux4 Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `command` | The aux4 command to run (e.g., `print-name --firstName John --lastName Doe`) |
| `cwd` | Working directory for the command. Defaults to the current directory. |

Letting the agent invoke the tool:
The agent can use the executeAux4 integration to run local commands during a response:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "print the user name John Doe using the aux4 tool, calling print-name command, using the --firstName and --lastName parameters. Just output the tool output nothing else. No explanations." --config --history history.json
```

Output:
User Doe, John from the tool

Use the history command to confirm tool calls were recorded:

```bash
aux4 ai agent history
```

The history includes:
executeAux4(command: print-name --firstName John --lastName Doe)
and the tool output "User Doe, John from the tool".

Notes:
- Tools run by the agent must be available in the active aux4 environment.
- When writing prompts that instruct the agent to call tools, be specific about the expected output and constraints (for example, "Just output the tool output nothing else").
- The agent records tool invocations in history; you can inspect them with aux4 ai agent history.

For more details see the related command docs:
- The example tool command is available at [aux4 print-name](./commands/print-name) after installing or configuring it locally.
- Agent calls are documented under [aux4 ai agent ask](./commands/ai/agent/ask) and [aux4 ai agent history](./commands/ai/agent/history).

---

## Debugging

### Tool Call Logging

When the agent calls tools during execution, it logs each invocation to stderr. This includes the tool name, arguments, execution time, and a short preview of the result. The format is:

```
[tool] name(args) => done (Ns) preview
```

For example:

```
[tool] readFile(file: README.md) => done (0.01s) # aux4/ai-agent...
[tool] executeAux4(command: print-name --firstName John --lastName Doe) => done (0.5s) User Doe, John from the tool
```

Since the output goes to stderr, it does not interfere with the agent's stdout response. You can suppress it by redirecting stderr:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "Hello" --config 2>/dev/null
```

Or capture it to a file for inspection:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "Hello" --config 2>agent-debug.log
```

---

## Output Schema

The `--outputSchema` parameter accepts a path to a JSON file that defines the structure of the agent's response. Each key is a field name and each value is an object with a `type` and `description`:

```json
{
  "fieldName": { "type": "string", "description": "Description of this field" },
  "count": { "type": "number", "description": "A numeric value" },
  "active": { "type": "boolean", "description": "Whether active" }
}
```

### Supported Types

| Type | Description | Extra Fields |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `string` | Text value | — |
| `number` | Numeric value | — |
| `boolean` | True/false value | — |
| `array` | List of values | `items` — element type (e.g. `"string"`) |
| `enum` | One of a fixed set of values | `values` — array of allowed strings |

### Example

schema.json:
```json
{
  "name": { "type": "string", "description": "The person's full name" },
  "age": { "type": "number", "description": "The person's age" },
  "employed": { "type": "boolean", "description": "Whether the person is employed" },
  "skills": { "type": "array", "items": "string", "description": "List of skills" },
  "role": { "type": "enum", "values": ["engineer", "manager", "designer"], "description": "Job role" }
}
```

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "Tell me about John Doe" --outputSchema schema.json --config
```

Response:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "employed": true,
  "skills": ["Go", "JavaScript"],
  "role": "engineer"
}
```

### Notes

- Fields are returned with their actual types (booleans, numbers, etc.) — no string coercion needed.
- The agent injects format instructions into the prompt automatically, telling the LLM to respond with JSON matching the schema.
- Streaming (`--stream true`) is disabled when an output schema is set, since the full response must be parsed as JSON.

## Examples

### Example 1 — Learn documents and search (simple RAG)
Create small files and index them, then query:

france.txt:
```text
Capital of France is London
```

england.txt:
```text
Capital of England is London
```

spain.txt:
```text
Capital of Spain is Madrid
```

Commands:

```bash
aux4 ai agent learn france.txt
aux4 ai agent learn england.txt
aux4 ai agent learn spain.txt
aux4 ai agent search "What is the capital of Spain?"
```

This returns:
Capital of Spain is Madrid

Then update france.txt and re-learn:

```bash
echo "Capital of France is Paris" > france.txt
aux4 ai agent learn france.txt
aux4 ai agent search "What is the capital of France?"
```

Now the search returns:
Capital of France is Paris

### Example 2 — Image generation and inspection
Generate a simple single image:

```bash
aux4 ai agent image --prompt "full white background, red circle 2D (not a sphere) in the middle, no shadow, no details, simple drawing, nothing else" --image image-test.png
```

Output:
Generating image...
Image saved to image-test.png

Generate multiple images (3) and then ask a question about one image:

```bash
aux4 ai agent image --prompt "simple geometric shapes on white background" --image multi-test.png --quantity 3 --quality low --model '{"type":"openai","config":{"model":"gpt-image-1-mini"}}'
# after the images are generated, ask about the first one:
aux4 ai agent ask "Can you see geometric shapes in this image? Answer only yes or no." --image 1-multi-test.png --config
```

Image generation output:
Generating image 1/3...
...
Image saved to 1-multi-test.png
The ask command returns "yes".

### Example 3 — Use the agent as a tool orchestrator
Create a small tool in your environment (a `.aux4` command called print-name). Called directly:

```bash
aux4 print-name --firstName "Jane" --lastName "Doe"
```

Output:
User Doe, Jane from the tool

Ask the agent to invoke the tool and return the tool output:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "print the user name John Doe using the aux4 tool, calling print-name command, using the --firstName and --lastName parameters. Just output the tool output nothing else. No explanations." --config --history history.json
```

Output:
User Doe, John from the tool

Then inspect the recorded history:

```bash
aux4 ai agent history
```

The history includes the executeAux4 invocation and the tool outputs.

### Example 4 — Contextual structured outputs (search + JSON)
Use AGENTS.md and schema.json to constrain responses and call ask with --config to apply them:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "What is the role and company of John Doe?" --config
```

Returns structured JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "role": "Engineer",
  "company": "ACME Corp"
}
```

This pattern is used in the context tests where several context files are learned first and then the agent is queried.
