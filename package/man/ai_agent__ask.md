#### Description

Ask a single question to the AI agent. The agent composes the prompt using an instructions file, optional conversation history, optional images, and retrieves relevant documents from the local vector store when configured. The response is printed to stdout.

Key features:

- **Agent identity** — give the agent a persona with `--bio` (a JSON object with `name`, `role`, `description`); it is rendered as a `# Agent Identity` system section so the agent knows who it is
- **Base instructions** — prepend an immutable base-prompt layer with `--baseInstructions <file>`, loaded before the main `--instructions` file
- **Prompt instructions** — load a custom instructions file to shape the assistant's behavior
- **Context from stdin** — pipe additional context into the prompt with `--context true`
- **Image input** — attach one or more images for visual question answering
- **Conversation history** — maintain multi-turn conversations via a history JSON file
- **Structured output** — constrain responses to a JSON schema
- **Streaming** — print tokens as they arrive with `--stream true`
- **Built-in tools** — the agent can call tools (readFile, writeFile, editFile, searchFiles, executeAux4, askUser, etc.) during execution
- **askUser tool** — when the agent needs clarification it can prompt the user; on a TTY it asks interactively, and in a non-interactive session it parks the question (see below)
- **Human-in-the-loop parking** — with `--humanInLoop park` (the default), a no-TTY `askUser` call or a permission `ask:` prompt suspends the run instead of silently auto-proceeding/auto-denying: the question is recorded in the history file, a structured `AUX4_PENDING_QUESTION` marker is emitted for a supervisor, and the turn ends with exit code `10`. Re-run with `--answer` (or the next question) to resume
- **Permissions** — control which aux4 commands and file operations the agent can perform using allow/ask/deny pattern lists
- **Policy guardrails** — an optional, enforced, swappable layer on top of permissions: per-run token/cost/call budgets, narrowing allow/deny rules, and escalation triggers (see `--policy`)
- **Model selection** — choose a named model from a registry with `--useModel` instead of passing inline model JSON
- **Codex** — set `api: codex` in the model config to use OpenAI models with your ChatGPT subscription via `~/.codex/auth.json`

Permissions control which aux4 commands and file operations the agent can perform. Patterns are evaluated in order: deny, ask, allow. Command patterns match tool executions (e.g., `hello`, `deploy*`). File patterns use the format `file:<scope>:<glob>` where scope is `read`, `write`, or `delete` (e.g., `file:write:*.env`, `file:read:*`). See the Permissions section in the README for full details.

Policy guardrails (`--policy`) add an optional, enforced layer on top of permissions. The effective permission for a tool is the static permissions **intersected** with the policy — a policy can only narrow, never grant. Only consequential tools (`executeAux4`, `writeFile`, `editFile`, `removeFiles`, `createDirectory`, `saveImage`) are gated; read-only tools are exempt. The policy is an inline object (aux4 delivers a config object as JSON automatically) and supports a per-run `budget` (`tokens`/`usd`/`calls`, read from the live token usage the run already maintains — no separate ledger), `allow`/`deny` rule lists, and `escalate` triggers (`block`/`notify` modes running any aux4 command with injected `${trigger}/${reason}/${agent}/${runId}/${action}/${spent}/${cap}/${escalationId}/${json}` variables). `${runId}` is auto-generated when `--runId` is not passed. When `--history` is set, each policy decision is recorded on the corresponding tool entry as a `policy` field. With no `--policy`, behavior is unchanged. See the Policy Guardrails section in the README, and `aux4 ai agent policy check` / `aux4 ai agent policy resolve`.

Auto-compaction requires both `--autoCompact true` and a `compaction` config with `contextWindow` set. When prompt tokens exceed the threshold (`contextWindow * maxContextPercent / 100`), older messages are automatically summarized.

Compaction config fields:
- `contextWindow` — model's context window size in tokens (required)
- `maxContextPercent` — trigger threshold as percentage (default: 85)
- `keepLastMessages` — recent messages to keep verbatim (default: 6)
- `model` — optional model config for summarization (defaults to main model)

**Agent identity (`--bio`):** Pass a JSON object describing who the agent is. The recognized fields are `name`, `role`, and `description`. When present, they are rendered as a `# Agent Identity` system section (bold `**Name:**` / `**Role:**` / `**Description:**` lines) and injected at the top of the system prompt — above the base instructions and the main instructions — so the agent consistently knows its persona. An empty or omitted `--bio` adds nothing. When stored in a config file under a top-level `bio:` key, aux4 delivers it as JSON automatically.

**Base instructions (`--baseInstructions`):** Pass a path to a file whose contents are loaded as system instructions **before** the main `--instructions` file. This is the immutable base-prompt layer: shared, always-on discipline that should not be overridden by the per-task instructions layered on top. The load order is: agent identity (`--bio`) → base instructions (`--baseInstructions`) → main instructions (`--instructions`).

**Skills directory:** When `--skills` points to a directory containing skill definitions, the agent discovers available skills at startup and can read their full instructions on demand using the `readSkill` tool. Each skill is a subdirectory with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and markdown instructions. See the Skills section in the README for the folder structure.

**Human-in-the-loop (`--humanInLoop`):** On a TTY, the `askUser` tool and permission `ask:` prompts always ask interactively — behavior is unchanged. Without a TTY (cron heartbeat, jobs, CI), the mode decides what happens:

- `park` (default): the run **suspends** on the first `askUser` question or permission `ask:` prompt. The pending question — its text, the tool that asked, and (for permissions) the requested command/file — is recorded in the `--history` file under `pendingQuestion`, a single-line `AUX4_PENDING_QUESTION <json>` marker is written to stderr for a supervisor to parse, and the process exits with code `10`. Nothing is auto-proceeded and nothing is auto-denied.
- `auto`: the legacy behavior — a no-TTY `askUser` returns "proceed with best judgment" and a no-TTY permission `ask:` is denied.

Parking requires `--history` (there must be somewhere to record the question and resume from); with no history file the mode falls back to `auto`.

**Resuming a parked question:** run `ask` again with the **same `--history`**. Provide the answer with `--answer "<text>"`, or simply pass it as the next `<question>` (when a pending question exists and no `--answer` is given, the question is treated as the answer). The answer is fed back to the waiting tool call — for `askUser` it becomes the tool result; for a permission it decides allow/deny, and on allow the original command runs — and the agent loop continues. If the agent parks again (a further question), the cycle repeats.

#### Example

Basic question:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config --question "What's the capital of France? Just output the name of the city, nothing else."
```

```text
Paris
```

Streaming output:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config --stream true --question "Explain what AI agents are in two sentences."
```

Tokens are printed to stdout as they arrive from the LLM.

With an image:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "Can you see geometric shapes in this image? Answer only yes or no." --image shapes.png --config
```

```text
yes
```

With piped context:

```bash
cat report.txt | aux4 ai agent ask --context true "Summarize the key findings"
```

With permissions (block file writes, allow everything else):

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "Create a file called output.txt" --config --permissions '{"allow":["*","file:read:*"],"ask":[],"deny":["file:write:*"]}'
```

```text
Permission denied: write "output.txt" is not allowed by the permissions configuration.
```

With a policy guardrail (cap the run and forbid destructive commands):

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "Clean up the open issues" --config \
  --policy '{"allow":[{"executeAux4":["github *"]}],"deny":[{"executeAux4":["* delete *"]}],"budget":{"tokens":50000}}'
```

If the agent attempts a denied or over-budget action, it receives a `⛔ policy ...` result and adapts.

With an agent identity (`--bio`):

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config \
  --bio '{"name":"Ada","role":"release manager","description":"Owns the CI/CD pipeline and cuts releases"}' \
  "Who are you and what do you do?"
```

```text
I'm Ada, the release manager. I own the CI/CD pipeline and cut releases.
```

With base instructions layered before the task instructions:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config \
  --baseInstructions base-policy.md \
  --instructions task.md \
  "Refactor the build script"
```

The contents of `base-policy.md` are loaded as the immutable base layer, then `task.md` is layered on top.

Human-in-the-loop, no TTY (park then resume):

```bash
# First run: the agent needs a decision but there is no TTY, so it parks and exits 10.
aux4 ai agent ask --config --history session.json "Deploy the app to the right environment"
```

```text
⏸ Paused: waiting for the user to answer a pending question. Run the agent again with the answer to continue.
```

A structured marker is emitted to stderr for a supervisor:

```text
AUX4_PENDING_QUESTION {"type":"pending_question","kind":"question","tool":"askUser","question":"Which environment — staging or production?","key":"ask:Which environment — staging or production?","timestamp":1720000000000}
```

```bash
# Resume with the answer against the same history; the loop continues from where it parked.
aux4 ai agent ask --config --history session.json --answer "staging" ""
```

With a named model from registry:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --configFile config.yaml --config agent --useModel fast "What is 2+2?"
```

With Codex (ChatGPT subscription, no API key needed):

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --model '{"api":"codex","config":{"model":"gpt-5.3-codex"}}' "What time is it?"
```
