#### Description

Ask a single question to the AI agent. The agent composes the prompt using an instructions file, optional conversation history, optional images, and retrieves relevant documents from the local vector store when configured. The response is printed to stdout.

Key features:

- **Agent identity** — give the agent a persona with `--bio` (a JSON object with `name`, `role`, `description`); it is rendered as a `# Agent Identity` system section so the agent knows who it is
- **Base instructions** — prepend an immutable base-prompt layer with `--baseInstructions <file>`, loaded before the main `--instructions` file
- **Prompt instructions** — load a custom instructions file to shape the assistant's behavior
- **Context from stdin** — pipe additional context into the prompt with `--context true`
- **Image input** — attach one or more images for visual question answering
- **Conversation history** — maintain multi-turn conversations via a history JSON file
- **Structured output** — constrain responses to a JSON schema
- **Streaming** — print tokens as they arrive with `--stream true`
- **Built-in tools** — the agent can call tools (readFile, writeFile, editFile, searchFiles, executeAux4, askUser, etc.) during execution
- **askUser tool** — when the agent needs clarification it can prompt the user interactively; in non-interactive sessions it proceeds with best judgment
- **Permissions** — control which aux4 commands and file operations the agent can perform using allow/ask/deny pattern lists
- **Policy guardrails** — an optional, enforced, swappable layer on top of permissions: per-run token/cost/call budgets, narrowing allow/deny rules, and escalation triggers (see `--policy`)
- **Loop budget** — a safety cap on the tool-execution loop: an always-on iteration cap (`--maxIterations`, default 50) plus optional token/time caps (`--budget`). When a limit trips the loop stops cleanly, appends a `[budget-exceeded]` note, persists history, and exits with code 7
- **Model selection** — choose a named model from a registry with `--useModel` instead of passing inline model JSON
- **Codex** — set `api: codex` in the model config to use OpenAI models with your ChatGPT subscription via `~/.codex/auth.json`

Permissions control which aux4 commands and file operations the agent can perform. Patterns are evaluated in order: deny, ask, allow. Command patterns match tool executions (e.g., `hello`, `deploy*`). File patterns use the format `file:<scope>:<glob>` where scope is `read`, `write`, or `delete` (e.g., `file:write:*.env`, `file:read:*`). See the Permissions section in the README for full details.

Policy guardrails (`--policy`) add an optional, enforced layer on top of permissions. The effective permission for a tool is the static permissions **intersected** with the policy — a policy can only narrow, never grant. Only consequential tools (`executeAux4`, `writeFile`, `editFile`, `removeFiles`, `createDirectory`, `saveImage`) are gated; read-only tools are exempt. The policy is an inline object (aux4 delivers a config object as JSON automatically) and supports a per-run `budget` (`tokens`/`usd`/`calls`, read from the live token usage the run already maintains — no separate ledger), `allow`/`deny` rule lists, and `escalate` triggers (`block`/`notify` modes running any aux4 command with injected `${trigger}/${reason}/${agent}/${runId}/${action}/${spent}/${cap}/${escalationId}/${json}` variables). `${runId}` is auto-generated when `--runId` is not passed. When `--history` is set, each policy decision is recorded on the corresponding tool entry as a `policy` field. With no `--policy`, behavior is unchanged. See the Policy Guardrails section in the README, and `aux4 ai agent policy check` / `aux4 ai agent policy resolve`.

Auto-compaction requires both `--autoCompact true` and a `compaction` config with `contextWindow` set. When prompt tokens exceed the threshold (`contextWindow * maxContextPercent / 100`), older messages are automatically summarized.

Compaction config fields:
- `contextWindow` — model's context window size in tokens (required)
- `maxContextPercent` — trigger threshold as percentage (default: 85)
- `keepLastMessages` — recent messages to keep verbatim (default: 6)
- `model` — optional model config for summarization (defaults to main model)

**Loop budget (`--maxIterations` / `--budget`):** The agent runs a tool-execution loop — invoke the model, run the tools it requests, feed results back, repeat — until the model stops asking for tools. The loop budget caps that loop so a misbehaving model cannot run forever. It applies to every ask and to every execute path (the standard LangChain path and the Codex path). Set the iteration cap with the simple `--maxIterations` flag (default 50), or supply a `--budget` JSON object for finer control; values in the `budget` object take precedence over the flag.

Budget config fields:
- `maxIterations` — hard cap on tool-execution rounds (always on; default 50)
- `maxTokens` — optional cap on total tokens consumed during the ask (default: no limit)
- `maxTimeMs` — optional cap on wall-clock time spent in the loop (default: no limit)

When any limit trips, the loop terminates cleanly rather than being abandoned: a final assistant note prefixed with `[budget-exceeded]` is appended (naming the limit and the tools the agent was about to call), the conversation history and accumulated token usage are persisted (when `--history` is set), that note is returned as the answer, and the command exits with code **7** (distinct from a generic failure) so a supervising process can detect the truncation and, for example, resume with a higher budget or escalate to a human.

**Agent identity (`--bio`):** Pass a JSON object describing who the agent is. The recognized fields are `name`, `role`, and `description`. When present, they are rendered as a `# Agent Identity` system section (bold `**Name:**` / `**Role:**` / `**Description:**` lines) and injected at the top of the system prompt — above the base instructions and the main instructions — so the agent consistently knows its persona. An empty or omitted `--bio` adds nothing. When stored in a config file under a top-level `bio:` key, aux4 delivers it as JSON automatically.

**Base instructions (`--baseInstructions`):** Pass a path to a file whose contents are loaded as system instructions **before** the main `--instructions` file. This is the immutable base-prompt layer: shared, always-on discipline that should not be overridden by the per-task instructions layered on top. The load order is: agent identity (`--bio`) → base instructions (`--baseInstructions`) → main instructions (`--instructions`).

**Skills directory:** When `--skills` points to a directory containing skill definitions, the agent discovers available skills at startup and can read their full instructions on demand using the `readSkill` tool. Each skill is a subdirectory with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and markdown instructions. See the Skills section in the README for the folder structure.

#### Example

Basic question:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config --question "What's the capital of France? Just output the name of the city, nothing else."
```

```text
Paris
```

Streaming output:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config --stream true --question "Explain what AI agents are in two sentences."
```

Tokens are printed to stdout as they arrive from the LLM.

With an image:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "Can you see geometric shapes in this image? Answer only yes or no." --image shapes.png --config
```

```text
yes
```

With piped context:

```bash
cat report.txt | aux4 ai agent ask --context true "Summarize the key findings"
```

With permissions (block file writes, allow everything else):

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "Create a file called output.txt" --config --permissions '{"allow":["*","file:read:*"],"ask":[],"deny":["file:write:*"]}'
```

```text
Permission denied: write "output.txt" is not allowed by the permissions configuration.
```

With a policy guardrail (cap the run and forbid destructive commands):

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask "Clean up the open issues" --config \
  --policy '{"allow":[{"executeAux4":["github *"]}],"deny":[{"executeAux4":["* delete *"]}],"budget":{"tokens":50000}}'
```

If the agent attempts a denied or over-budget action, it receives a `⛔ policy ...` result and adapts.

With a loop budget (cap iterations, tokens, and wall-clock time):

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config \
  --budget '{"maxIterations":100,"maxTokens":200000,"maxTimeMs":600000}' \
  "Research this topic thoroughly and summarize"
```

If the loop hits a limit, the answer is a budget-exceeded note and the command exits with code 7:

```text
[budget-exceeded] Loop budget exceeded: maximum tool-loop iterations reached (limit 100). The task was stopped before completion to prevent a runaway tool loop. The agent was about to call: executeAux4.
```

With an agent identity (`--bio`):

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config \
  --bio '{"name":"Ada","role":"release manager","description":"Owns the CI/CD pipeline and cuts releases"}' \
  "Who are you and what do you do?"
```

```text
I'm Ada, the release manager. I own the CI/CD pipeline and cut releases.
```

With base instructions layered before the task instructions:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --config \
  --baseInstructions base-policy.md \
  --instructions task.md \
  "Refactor the build script"
```

The contents of `base-policy.md` are loaded as the immutable base layer, then `task.md` is layered on top.

With a named model from registry:

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --configFile config.yaml --config agent --useModel fast "What is 2+2?"
```

With Codex (ChatGPT subscription, no API key needed):

```bash
aux4 ai agent ask --model '{"api":"codex","config":{"model":"gpt-5.3-codex"}}' "What time is it?"
```
